ABOUT THE PROJECT : For this project, I worked on creating a mockup and prototype for a furniture shopping app that uses AR, or augmented reality, to help buyers see how furniture and decor items will look in their own homes before they buy them. The idea for this project came from the common problem many people face when shopping for furniture online. Sometimes, after buying a piece of furniture, they find that it does not match the look of their room or does not fit well in the space they have. This often leads to returning the product, which takes time and effort. I wanted to solve this problem by giving users an easy way to see exactly how an item will look in their space using AR.I designed this project completely using Figma. Throughout this project, I learned how to use Figma better, how to design neat screens, place icons and text in the right places, and how to create a flow that feels smooth for the user. I also took reference images from Pinterest to make the screens look realistic and relatable. My goal was to keep the design clean, simple, and easy to use so that users can focus on the product and the AR experience without any confusion.
In my prototype, the app starts with a simple home screen where users can search for the furniture they want. There is also a section that talks about the AR feature so users know what makes this app special. Users can choose between different categories like decor, couches, tables, chairs, and more. The main idea is that they can browse products just like they would on any other shopping app.The important part comes when they see a product they like. Next to each furniture item, there is a ‘View’ button. When they click this button, the AR feature opens up. The phone’s camera turns on and the user can place a virtual version of the furniture in their room. They can move it around, rotate it, and see if it matches the space. This helps them decide if they really want to buy it. This means they don’t have to guess if a table or couch will look good in their living room — they can see it live in their space before they spend any money.I also added simple buttons like filters, sort, favourites, and recents on the product screen. These help users find what they need faster. The filter and sort buttons let them sort items by price, size, or style, which saves time. I made sure that the design is not crowded so that the focus stays on the furniture photos and the AR feature.At the bottom of the app, there is a simple navigation bar so users can go to the home screen, search for items, check their cart, see notifications, or look at their profile easily. This is the same as most shopping apps so it feels familiar.By doing this project, I learned how AR can be added to an everyday shopping experience to make it more helpful and practical. I also improved my Figma skills by making multiple screens and creating an easy-to-follow flow. Overall, this AR furniture shopping app prototype is meant to help people shop smarter and avoid the trouble of returns and mismatched furniture. I really enjoyed designing this because it solves a real problem and uses new technology in a simple way.
